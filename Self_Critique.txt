Self Critique for Project 1

To start off, the project as a whole did come out to how I somewhat I wanted it to look like and function
The entire top level navigation is fully functional, despite the fact that I did have a hard time implementing it along with the 
css to style it to look good. In general the top level nav and sidebar gave me the most difficultly. For the sidebar itself,
I didnt' manage to fix it complelty as in the data and research page, the sidebar does not end where the main body of the page ends. 
I tried to change things in the css however, nothing seemed to work. Using a guide I found online on how to implement a sidebar
I tried to replicate it to my own way, however I was still having trouble. Another area where improvement could have been made is the spacing throguhout the webiste.
Initially I did try to to include <br> between paragraph and images, however that affected the sidebar and so I decided it was 
best if I didn't include <br> to have more spacing. The above are the major issues I myself encountered while looking back on the project.
